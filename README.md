# GratisBrocki

A platform that can be freely used by everyone to share or to give away all kinds of things for free. Some of the main goals are
* to make sustainable resource use easier
* to help transition to a minimalist lifestyle
* to facilitate giving and sharing without financial motives
* to create a free and simple, but effective platform

GratisBrocki was developed as part of a student project on object-oriented programming.
